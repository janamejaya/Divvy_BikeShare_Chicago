This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook used for training a neural network model with the training data while monitoring the performance on the validation data, and finally, make predictions on the test dataset.

Make sure you run the Jupyter notebook in the data\_splits directory first.

ps: if you have looked at the notebook and havent figured it out yet, there is a 'reason' why the model works so well. I have built other models to address this 'reason'.
