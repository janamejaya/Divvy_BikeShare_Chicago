This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook that can be used to split the data saved after running the exploratory data analysis into a training, validation, and a test dataset. 

Make sure you run the notebook after unzipping the files in the directory so they can be recreated and running the exploratory data analysis script in the directory ../EDA\_plus\_features
